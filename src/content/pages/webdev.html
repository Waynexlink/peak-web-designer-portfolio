    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

        Fast, Custom Websites That Actually Work in Nigeria
      </h1>

      <h2 class="cs-hide-on-mobile">
        Custom Code - NO WordPress Templates Or Page Builders
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most Nigerian websites fail before they launch. I see it constantly:
        beautiful designs that take 20+ seconds to load, mobile layouts that
        break on actual phones, and sites that function more like expensive
        digital brochures than business tools. Instead of WordPress templates or
        page builders, I write every line of code from scratch - delivering
        measurable performance that directly impacts your business results.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Hand-Coded Websites Matter in Nigeria</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Load in under 2 seconds on Nigerian networks</li>
        <li>Work perfectly on budget smartphones</li>
        <li>Use minimal data (crucial for your customers)</li>
        <li>Rank higher on Google searches</li>
        <li>Convert more visitors into customers</li>
        <li>Completely secure - impossible to hack</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Nigerian Network Reality: Speed Equals Revenue</h4>
      <p>
        When 90% of your customers browse on mobile with limited data, website
        performance isn't technical preference—it's business necessity. If your
        website takes <strong>more than 3 seconds to load</strong>,
        <strong>you lose up to 50% of visitors</strong> before they see your
        content. They simply don't wait that long on Nigerian networks. My
        hand-coded sites load so fast visitors can't leave, capturing leads your
        old site missed.
      </p>

      <h4>Better Performance = Lower Marketing Costs</h4>
      <p>
        Fast websites don't just convert better—they cost less to promote.
        Google rewards fast-loading sites with lower advertising costs and
        higher search rankings. When your site loads instantly, every marketing
        naira works harder. Whether you're running Facebook ads or Google
        campaigns, performance directly impacts your return on investment.
      </p>

      <h4>Custom Code Means Zero Security Vulnerabilities</h4>
      <p>
        WordPress sites get hacked constantly because they're built on complex
        systems with multiple entry points. Hackers target WordPress
        specifically because it's easier to break into, especially if updates
        aren't maintained perfectly. My custom code approach eliminates these
        risks entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        With static HTML and CSS files, there's nothing for hackers to exploit.
        No databases, no plugins, no server-side vulnerabilities. I can deploy a
        site and leave it untouched for years without security concerns. It's
        digital infrastructure built to last.
      </p>

      <h4>Dominate Local Search Results</h4>
      <p>
        Google prioritizes fast websites in search rankings. When two similar
        businesses compete for the same keywords, the faster site wins. But
        speed creates additional advantages beyond direct ranking factors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast sites keep visitors engaged longer, creating higher session times
        and better click-through rates. Google interprets this engagement as
        quality signals, boosting your overall search authority. More traffic
        leads to higher rankings, creating a positive feedback loop that
        compounds over time.
      </p>

      <h4>Boost Your Google Business Profile Visibility</h4>
      <p>
        Website performance directly impacts your Google Business Profile
        ranking in Maps searches. Fast-loading sites signal quality to Google's
        algorithms, improving your visibility when Nigerians search for local
        businesses. Combined with strategic review management and complete
        profile optimization, performance becomes a competitive advantage in
        local search results.
      </p>

      <h2>Nigerian Business SEO Specialist</h2>
      <p>
        Web design and SEO work together, especially in competitive Nigerian
        markets. A well-built website needs strategic optimization to generate
        consistent leads. That's why I combine technical excellence with proven
        SEO strategies specifically calibrated for Nigerian search behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        Forget generic advice like "optimize your meta tags" or "submit a
        sitemap"—those are basic requirements, not SEO services. Real SEO
        involves strategic content creation, local backlinking, consistent
        blogging, and performance monitoring. If you want to understand how I
        help Nigerian businesses dominate their local search results, let's
        schedule a detailed consultation to discuss your specific market
        challenges.
