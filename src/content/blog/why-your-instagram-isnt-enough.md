## Introduction

For many Nigerian entrepreneurs, the first step in starting a business is opening an Instagram page. It feels free, easy, and gives you quick access to followers. For a while, it works — customers DM you, you post pictures, and sales trickle in.

But here’s the problem: **depending only on Instagram is risky and limiting.** If your account gets hacked, disabled, or shadow-banned, your business disappears overnight. Worse, people searching on Google — where most serious buyers start — will never find you.

This article will show you why relying only on Instagram holds back your growth, and why pairing it with a website is the smarter move.

## Social Media Has Its Limits

Instagram and Facebook are great for visibility, but they don’t give you control. Algorithms decide who sees your posts, and even if you have thousands of followers, only a fraction may actually see your updates.

Another issue: information is hard to find. If a customer wants to know your price list or service details, they must scroll endlessly. Many won’t bother — they’ll leave and choose a competitor with clearer information.

Finally, let’s face it: not everyone uses Instagram. Many Nigerians, especially professionals, go straight to Google when searching for services like _“lawyer in Abuja”_ or _“tailor in Surulere.”_ If you’re not there, you’re invisible.

## Why a Website Changes the Game

A website is your **digital shop you truly own.** Nobody can ban or delete it. Customers can always reach you, day or night, without waiting for a DM reply.

Unlike social media, a website puts your business directly on Google, where customers are already searching with buying intent. It also builds instant credibility — when people see you have a proper website, they see you as trustworthy and professional.

Think of it like this: Instagram is your market stall in a noisy open market. A website is your permanent shop with a signboard on the main road. Which one looks more serious to a customer ready to spend?

## Website + Instagram = Maximum Results

The truth is, you don’t have to abandon Instagram. Instead, combine it with your website. Social media grabs attention, while your website converts that attention into real sales, calls, and store visits.

For example: someone sees your Instagram post, clicks your bio link, and lands on your website where they can instantly call, chat on WhatsApp, or make a payment. That’s how you turn likes into paying customers.

## Conclusion

Depending only on Instagram is like renting space in someone else’s shop — the landlord can kick you out anytime. A website, on the other hand, is your permanent property online.

If you want stability, professionalism, and more customers finding you, the answer is clear: build a website that works for your business.
