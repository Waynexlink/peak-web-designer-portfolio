## Introduction

When most Nigerians need a service — whether it’s a tailor in Surulere, a restaurant in Lekki, or a lawyer in Abuja — their first stop isn’t Instagram. It’s **Google.**

Yet, the reality is this: most small businesses in Nigeria don’t show up in search results. That means potential customers are skipping you and going straight to competitors who took the time to optimize their online presence.

The good news? Getting found on Google is not as complicated (or expensive) as people think. Here are five practical steps you can take today to start attracting more customers.

## 1. Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile

When people search for “restaurant near me” or “mechanic in Ikeja,” Google often shows a map with local businesses. If you don’t appear there, you’re invisible.

Claim your Google Business Profile (it’s free), fill in your correct details — business name, phone, hours, and location — and add clear photos. Ask happy customers to leave reviews. This alone can bring in more calls and walk-in traffic.

## 2. Create Service Pages for What You Offer

Many Nigerian businesses only have a homepage. That’s not enough. Google ranks specific pages, not just one general page.

If you’re a plumber, don’t just have “Home.” Create pages like “Plumbing Services in Lagos” or “Emergency Plumber in Surulere.” The more specific you are, the easier it is for Google to match you with local searches.

## 3. Make Sure Your Website Loads Fast on Mobile

Over 80% of Nigerians browse the internet on mobile with limited data. If your site takes more than three seconds to load, most visitors will leave.

Use lightweight designs, compress images, and avoid heavy templates. A fast website doesn’t just keep customers engaged — it also ranks higher on Google.

## 4. Use Local Keywords Nigerians Actually Search For

Instead of generic terms like “best tailor,” think local: “tailor in Yaba,” “wedding tailor in Abuja.”

This is how real people search. Add these location-based keywords naturally into your service pages, blog posts, and even your Google Business Profile.

## 5. Keep Adding Fresh Content

Google favors websites that stay active. Posting helpful blog articles, FAQs, or even seasonal tips shows you’re relevant.

For example, a catering business could write: _“Top Wedding Catering Trends in Lagos”_ or _“5 Budget-Friendly Party Ideas for Abuja.”_ These articles not only bring in traffic but also build trust with potential customers.

## Conclusion

Getting more customers from Google doesn’t require big budgets or complicated tricks. It’s about setting up the basics — a proper Google Business Profile, fast-loading mobile site, service pages, local keywords, and consistent content.

Most of your competitors won’t bother to do these things. That’s your opportunity.
